## Data Model

The application uses a SQLite-backed data model with meaningful identifiers:

1. **Activities** - Uses activity name as identifier:

   - Description
   - Schedule
   - Maximum number of participants allowed
   - List of student emails who are signed up

2. **Students** - Uses email as identifier:
   - Name
   - Grade level
3. **Enrollments** - Connects students and activities:
   - Each enrollment links one student email to one activity
   - Duplicate enrollments are blocked by a database unique constraint

On first startup, the app seeds the database with the default activities and participants.
Data is stored in `src/activities.db`, so signups persist across server restarts.
